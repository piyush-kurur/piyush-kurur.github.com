  <h1 id="post-title">Catholic church and Evolution</h1>
  <p>The Indian Express <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-others/pope-francis-says-big-bang-theory-does-not-contradict-role-of-god/">reported recently</a> on Pope Francis openly supporting the theory of evolution and the big bang saying that it does not contradict the teachings of the Catholic church. As a scientist should I be excited about it? Is the catholic church finally <em>growing up</em> to accept what has undoubtedly been scientifically well established?</p>
<p>It seems that the Catholic church did not have much problems with the theory of evolution for quite some time with Pope John Paul II <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp961022.htm">more or less confirming it in 1996</a>. As for big-bang, the first academic to suggest and expanding universe was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lemaître" title="Wikipedia: Georges Lemaître">Georges Lemaître</a>, an astronomer who happens to be a priest. So this stance of the current Pope should not be very surprising.</p>
<p>The real reason for church taking a more liberal view is probably due to the fact that they are losing followers, in fact quite dramatically I am told, in Europe. As this <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/evolution-in-rome/">editorial</a> points out, the church has in recent times lost quite a bit of its moral authority due to various scandals that has come out against it. Purging the rot that sets in due to the years of unquestioned wealth and power is not easy, even with god on ones side.</p>
<p>One closer reading, what the pope actually said about evolution and big-bang is not as <em>inspiring</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> as it appears to be. Evolution and big-bang, according to the pope, <em>requires</em> the existence of god. Unfortunately for the church the facts shows otherwise. The <em>role</em> of the divine in the natural world has been constantly dwindling as we understand more are more of the natural world. We now know quite a bit on the working of the world that the role of god is essentially the role of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_soup" title="Wikipedia: Stone soup">stone in the stone soup</a>. I can understand the difficulty for the pope to <em>admit</em> the possibility of a natural world with no god. But if he does, then that is the first <em>baby step</em> towards an enlightened church.</p>
